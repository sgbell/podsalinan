Todo List
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Create the Dialog Boxes for Adding URL to download, and Adding Rss Feeds, and Changing Directory
  -- Completed
* Make program download a file from the internet and store it in a storage directory.. IE podcast feed
  -- Program is downloading files, but need to change the way it works as it does not give
     a progress.
* Read the podcast feed, and extract the information to view.
	This being -
		Podcast img
		Each episode
		Episode Information
  -- Completed
* Need to fix the Downloader class. It's either downloading way too slow or it's just faulty. Need to
	download the file the old fashioned way.
  -- Completed	
* Use Wait/Notify between DownloadQueue and Downloader so we don't waste cpu cycles
	on nothing.
  -- Completed
* Add functionality to "Change Download Directory"
  -- In Progress
* Changing linking of RssFeed vector and DownloadQueue vector, so when details are changed from RssFeed,
	it automatically changes the details, as they will all be pointing to the same information.
* Change Classes that extend Thread Class to Implement Runnable instead.
* Create a listener, as found in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/702415/how-to-know-if-other-threads-have-finished
	to monitor when a thread is finished and remove it from the downloaderqueue.
	
* Store program settings in config files.
* Scan the chosen directory to see what needs to be downloaded, and then proceed with a download queue.
